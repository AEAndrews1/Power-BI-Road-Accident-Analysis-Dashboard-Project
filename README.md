# Power-BI-Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard-Project
A project where I created a dynamic and interactive road accident analysis dashboard where I satisfied the primary KPI's of total CY Casualties , total CY Accidents, their YoY Growth. and Total casualties with respect to accident severity
As well as Secondary KPI's such as total casualties with respect to vehicle type, CY vs PY monthly trend, total casualties with respect to road type, total casualties with respect to area, day/night time as well as location
I made two versions of this, one with a stacked bar chart showing total casualties with respect to individual locations, and another version with an interactive map with plot points.
